1. to alert the user that the username already exists. maybe using javascript to use its alert function
2. at any step of registration, once we discovered a mistake, to alert the user!
3. to uncomment the:
#defining counter and getting the number of tries that we have
global counterLoginTries
counterLoginTries=login_tries
# if the counter is 0, we return false
    # we must here to refresh the page or something+alerting the user that he tried to sign up too many times
    if (counterLoginTries == 0):
        return False
    #decrementing by one the counter
    counterLoginTries-=1
and establish a new function that knows how to take care of login numbers

4. to insert to the data base not the hash format because it changes every time.
5.#todo: to remove salt from the database 
6. to remove the password from users table
